This isn’t your typical ChatGPT article.

You know, the hyperbolic “*6 Mindblowing ChatGPT Secrets 99% of People Don’t Know About”* kind. The actual “secret” most don’t know?

ChatGPT itself can write such clickbaity ChatGPT blogs! Try it yourself:

> **Prompt:** “Act as a professional writer specializing in ChatGPT and AI. Use a persuasive voice, creative style, and a friendly tone. Rewrite your answers until they sound as human-like as possible.  
> Now, write an 800-word essay titled ‘6 Mindblowing ChatGPT Uses 99% of People Don’t Know About’ with appropriate H1, H2, and body formatting.”

A dash of rephrasing. A pinch of plagiarism-proofing. Boom! Off into the hype-riding ocean of ChatGPT content.

Refusing to surf this hype, I didn’t write any “ChatGPT Uses” articles in the 10 months since my [first one](https://medium.com/publishous/10-creative-chatgpt-usages-to-supercharge-your-daily-productivity-b0b64d19475f) went viral.

Tinkering with ChatGPT in silence, I found and honed 3 meta-uses— for expert advice, precise browsing, and fact-checking.

==**They’re “meta” as they fan out into**== ==***myriad***== ==**specific usages**== ==— learning niche concepts, content researching, debugging code, recalling lost ideas, filtering misinformation, etc.==

Unlike most ChatGPT articles, I won’t share solo vanilla prompts and call it a day. Instead, I’ll…

- Share optimized compound prompts — with 3 enhancements for each use case.
- Dissect composite prompts part by part and explain the rationale.
- Wrap it all up with prompt templates you can plug and play.

These meta-prompts have worked wonders for my research speed, workflow, and idea/concept recall. I hope they do the same (and more) for you.

Before we dive in, fire up ChatGPT on a new tab — to prompt as you read.

## #1 — Name-Prime ChatGPT Into a Niche Expert

Hunting for signal bars around the bamboo house, we squatted on a dusty tree trunk.

“Ah! Finally”, gingerly holding the tab, “Brother, now watch ChatGPT’s power. Let’s try coconut oil extraction”, I beamed at my farmer friend.

> **Prompt 1.1:** “Act as an expert Indian organic farmer specializing in coconut farming for coconut oil production. Now explain the step-by-step process from start to end to produce coconut oil.”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*NJguv9vQeq2YQahWmsLmcQ.jpeg)

This was a hyper-simple version of ChatGPT “priming”—aka laser-focusing ChatGPT’s expertise on a specific topic(s).

True name-priming is *far* more powerful — but I didn’t use it to avoid overwhelming my tech-unsavvy pal.

Let me illustrate by awakening ChatGPT’s inner grammar Nazi:

> **Prompt 1.2:** “You’re now GrammarGPT — a world-class English language, literary, and grammar expert. Henceforth, whenever I ask you a question, respond with relevant, expert, and well-thought-out answers. Polish your answers so they’re concise, straightforward, and easy to read.  
> Till this window is closed and/or I specify otherwise, assume I’m referring to you, GrammarGPT.  
> If you understand your job, describe it to me. If you don’t, speak out your doubts so I can clarify them.”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.2](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*nALl-gHqx7wMwt1e0PkuHA.jpeg)

Before diving into follow-up prompts, let’s first dissect this beast of a prompt:

- *“You’re now GrammarGPT…”* — while “Act as an X expert” alone will work, a name allows easy switching. ChatGPT, GrammarGPT, or [PhiloGPT](https://medium.com/publishous/philogpts-surprisingly-wise-answer-to-what-s-the-meaning-of-life-408a058309e4), switch with a *“Switch (back) to {X}GPT”* prompt.

![Screenshot showing how ChatGPT can switch between name-primed ChatGPTs](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-EcPWXsJ10DaKTJxfVRwcQ.jpeg)

Edited with Skitch

- *“Henceforth, whenever I ask you…”* — so ChatGPT ensures a high, reliable standard for every answer.
- *“Polish your answers…” —* so ChatGPT formats each response as we desire.
- *“Till this window is closed…” —* so ChatGPT stays GrammarGPT until you close the tab.
- *“If you understand your job…” —* to check if ChatGPT has understood its GrammarGPT role.

When Googling and Grammarly prove useless, GrammarGPT swoops in to the rescue.

> **Prompt 1.3:** “I am looking to shorten the sentence “I want to make you aware of…” but am at a loss for verb forms of “Aware.” Can you suggest 15 richer and more literary alternatives please?”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.3](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*pvjzu4UcfHft7pDApm3DZw.jpeg)

Edited with Skitch

> **Prompt 1.4:** “I want a single-word phrase that describes someone who falls in between being frugal and a spendthrift.”
> 
> **Follow-up:** “Any other alternatives? Moderate can mean moderate in anything. I need a word that’s more context-specific”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.4 and its follow-up](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*HaGEzL3LWNxeDqnoD1xe4Q.jpeg)

Be it choppy sentences in need of smoothening or stale vocabulary that needs enriching, GrammarGPT is at your service.

Still frustrated? Banter with ChatGPT’s inner stand-up comedian:

> **Prompt 1.5:** “You’re now ComedyGPT — a world-class stand-up comedian rivaling the likes of Andrew Schulz and Dave Chappelle. Henceforth, whenever I say anything to you — no matter how random — use it to derive stomach-hurtlingly lethal humor. Don’t hesitate to use puns, double entendres, and bold wordplay. Do you understand your job, ComedyGPT?”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.5](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*N6hIAVtuzBNkVIc2sJgT0w.jpeg)

## 3 Ways to Further Strengthen ChatGPT’s Name-Priming:

- Describe specific (re)sources and/or historical/living figures for ChatGPT to draw from.

> **Prompt 1.6:** “You’re now back to being PhiloGPT. Henceforth, PhiloGPT, draw specifically from Stoicism, Alan Watts, and Advaita Vedanta to formulate your answers. Mix and match with your own creativity and judgement. Now, I’d love to know what the meaning of life is?”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.6](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*_9lCVoRPK6bugzmd66z6iA.jpeg)

- Make ChatGPT leverage each response to enrich the subsequent ones.

> **Prompt 1.7:** “PhiloGPT, henceforth, with every response you generate, utilize the context of the generated response to broaden your selection of resources and expertise for each subsequent response. Makes sense?  
> Now, what’s the meaning of life again?”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.7](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZWS9Jc3DF0mc9kKo8yNTYw.jpeg)

Notice how PhiloGPT branched out into absurdism after Jean-Paul Sartre

- Combine multiple name-primed ChatGPTs you’ve already defined.

> **Prompt 1.8: “**You’re now PhiloComGPT — a hybrid of PhiloGPT and ComedyGPT. Now, what’s the meaning of life, PhiloComGPT?”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 1.8 — the hilarious and philosophical output of PhiloComGPT](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9LweTpYRoiX7e5p6q9GQ5A.jpeg)

> “==The cosmic joke is that we are both the comedian and the audience, playing hide-and-seek with our own divinity==”
> 
> — PhiloComGPT, Circa 2023

## #2 — Meta-Search with ChatGPT when Googling Fails

We often have something at “our fingertips” we can’t pinpoint — too unclear to Google or ask a topical expert.

It could be a quote, pop-culture meme, scientific term, or song.

With ChatGPT, we no longer have to bang our heads or hope for a toilet-seat “Eureka!” moment.

> **Prompt 2.1:** “What is that phrase sounding something like “heebly beeblies” we use to say when something is scary enough to give us the shivers? Or something along similar lines? I can’t seem to put my finger on it.”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 2.1 answering “Heebie-jeebies”](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*qoD-vDFFZZwzBckDSRFv5Q.jpeg)

> **Prompt 2.2:** What is the name of the human tendency to keep looking for the secret sauce — or something along those lines? It’s a well-documented cognitive bias I can’t seem to recall the exact name of.

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 2.2](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*XsCvl9tUlu_XR1E_RKzD0Q.jpeg)

While simpler than name-priming, the meta-searching prompt has 3 crucial components:

- *An As-Specific-As-Possible (ASAP) description* — the vaguer your description, the harder it’s for ChatGPT to zone in.
- *“Something along those/similar lines*” — to prompt ChatGPT to expand its field of search and guesses. This makes up for inaccurate descriptions.
- *“I can’t seem to (recall exactly)/(put my finger on it)”* — conveys surety that your target exists and is definite — even if you can’t recall it.

==Think of ChatGPT as a near-omnipotent child — he’ll work wonders, but you must be articulate.==

## 3 Ways to Enhance ChatGPT’s Meta-Searching Ability:

- Prompt ChatGPT to ask you questions if it’s unable to zone in.

> **Prompt 2.3:** “If you’re unable to guess accurately or zone in, feel free to ask me follow-up questions so we can zone in better.”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 2.3 — ChatGPT asking questions to better guess](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*tF1KGD1eVb5ckOHK-uyR1Q.jpeg)

- Ask ChatGPT for multiple guesses — and guess by guess, inch closer to whatever you’re searching.

> **Prompt 2.4:** “Suggest 4–10 guesses. I’ll let you know which of them is the closest to what I’m looking for — so you can zone in better.”

![Screenshot of ChatGPT’s output for prompt 2.4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*bQsO7t7aX-xnIkEdChUkyQ.jpeg)

- Name-prime ChatGPT before meta-searching — works if you roughly know your target's topic.

> **Prompt 2.5:** You’re now PsychoGPT — a world-class psychology expert specializing in cognitive biases and social human psychology. Henceforth, whenever I ask you questions, respond with relevant, expert, and well-thought-out answers.

## #3 — Pit ChatGPT against ChatGPT for Fact-Checking

For all its endless knowledge and polite fluency, ChatGPT isn’t trustworthy!

ChatGPT sews up holes in its answers with made-up facts — [one study found](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-06-29/chatgpt-lies-better-than-humans.html) AI more convincing of a liar than humans! As programmer [Stephen Diehl put it](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1627476629441376257?lang=en),

> “ChatGPT is glorified Autocomplete. It’s a cool parlor trick and fascinating from a maths and linguistic perspective. But it’s not sentient and has no personality, agency, or intent. It reflects back the internet’s unfiltered text as a probabilistic mirror.”

Luckily, ChatGPT spills the beans if you follow up with an “*Are you 100% sure?”* prompt.

Edited with Skitch

==Surprisingly, ChatGPT is a reliable fact-====*checker*== — be it quote sources, historical accuracy, or research claims.

Without name-priming, ChatGPT deftly spotted [a TOI fat-loss](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/7-steps-to-a-flat-tummy-in-7-days/articleshow/12328383.cms) blog’s B.S.

Talk about hypocrisy!

But you can leverage this hypocrisy by pitting ChatGPT against ChatGPT.

- Fire up ChatGPT parallely on 2 separate browser tabs.
- Use one as a name-primed expert or a meta searcher — let the 2nd one be the fact-checker.
- Copy-paste the generator’s output into the checker and append, *“Is the above text 100% true? Can you please rigorously fact-check this for me?”*

Feed the checker’s output *back* into the generator for rigorous use cases like programming or research.

Keep going back and forth until you reach a satisfying accuracy.

## 3 Ways to Boost ChatGPT’s Legitness and Fact-Checking Ability:

- Regenerate with the exact prompt multiple times — in different chat windows. Consistent responses? Maybe true. But inconsistent responses? *Definitely* false.
- Ask ChatGPT to cite its sources in a detailed manner. Google to verify since ChatGPT can make up sources, too!

> **Append to your Prompts: “**Cite your sources as accurately as you possibly can, please — if you can’t, at least provide precise book/interview/report/research\_paper names I can look up.”

![ChatGPT providing book/papers/resource recommendations for The Battle Of Waterloo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ctkTmH8JuMlbPrNQ0AHSpw.jpeg)

- Name-prime ChatGPT to be trustworthy — this still doesn’t “guarantee” legitness, so do your due diligence.

> **Prompt:** You’re now TrustGPT — you’ll be 100% honest in your answers and not make up any facts, information, or data. Only if you’re 100% sure about something will you answer it. If not, you’ll admit you aren’t sure — so I can rely on you. Can I rely on you, TrustGPT?

## Prompt Templates For You To Plug-And-Play

Crafting powerful ChatGPT prompts is a game of iteration — reword, regenerate, follow up, recombine, repeat. Some spend *days* crafting [God-like prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14d7pfz/become_god_like_prompt_engineer_with_this_one/)!

But I’ll save you the effort — by sharing ready-to-use prompt templates for the use cases we covered.

- **Name-Prime ChatGPT into a nuanced niche expert:**

> “You’re now {NAME}GPT — a world-class {TOPIC} expert in. Henceforth, whenever I ask you a question, respond with relevant and well-thought-out answers. Draw specifically from {SOURCES} to formulate your answers. Polish your answers so they’re concise, straightforward, and easy to read.  
> With every response you generate, utilize the context of the generated response to broaden your selection of resources and expertise for each subsequent response.  
> Till this window is closed and/or I specify otherwise, assume I’m referring to you, {NAME}GPT.  
> If you understand your job, describe it to me. If you don’t, speak out your doubts so I can clarify them.”

- **Meta-search with ChatGPT where and when Googling fails:**

> What is that {SEARCH\_TARGET} sounding something like {DETAILS} often used in/by/for {CONTEXT}. Or something along similar lines? I can’t seem to put my finger on it. Suggest {X} guesses. I’ll let you know which of them is the closest to what I’m looking for. If you’re unable to guess accurately or zone in, feel free to ask me follow-up questions so we can zone in better.”

- **Get more trustworthy answers and fact-check with ChatGPT:**

> *Prime generation to be more trust-worthy:*  
> “You’re now TrustGPT — you’ll be 100% honest in your answers and not make up any facts or information. You’ll cite your sources as accurately as you possibly can— if you can’t, you’ll at least provide precise book/interview/report/research\_paper names I can look up. Only if you’re 100% sure about something will you answer it. If not, you’ll admit you aren’t sure — so I can rely on you. Can I rely on you, TrustGPT?
> 
> *For fact-checking, append the text to be checked with:*  
> “Is the above text 100% true? Can you please rigorously fact-check this for me?”

These prompts aren’t mutually exclusive — permute and cross-breed them for best results!

Name-prime before using ChatGPT. Sharpen the specificity of your browsing and generation(s) with meta-searching. Keep a rival ChatGPT instance handy for fact-checking.

ChatGPT is a true mass-access superpower.

Companies, content mills, and creators are wielding ChatGPT to make millions. The *least* you can do is use it to enhance your daily life and workflow.

No need to be tech-savvy, buy ChatGPT courses, or tinker with complex prompts. You only need curiosity, creativity, and 10 daily minutes.

Hate it or love it, AI is here to stay. But…

> ==AI won’t replace you or your job — someone cleverly leveraging AI will.==

Will that someone be you, dear reader?
