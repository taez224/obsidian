Library Mode vs. Framework Mode

With the release of React Router 7, things are getting even more exciting. This isn’t just another version with minor updates. It’s a major leap forward that allows React Router to wear two hats. It can still be your trusty routing library, just as it has always been, but now it can also act as a framework — yes, a framework! That means you can use it not only to manage routes but also to build full-stack React applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR), code splitting, and even file-based routing.

This dual personality is a game-changer. For years, developers have turned to frameworks like Next.js or Remix when building full-stack apps. Now, React Router 7 lets you stay in familiar territory while offering similar capabilities. Whether you’re working on a single-page app or exploring server-side rendering, React Router 7 adapts to your needs. It’s versatile, powerful, and ready to take your projects to the next level.

## Installation Updates: One Package to Rule Them All

With React Router 7, installing and managing your routing library has become simpler and more streamlined. The core functionality is now unified into a single package: `react-router`. This eliminates the need to install multiple packages like `react-router-dom` for web applications or other variations for different platforms.

React Router

## How to Install React Router 7

To get started, you only need to install the `react-router` package:

```
npm install react-router
```

This single package includes everything you need to set up routing in your React application, whether you are building for the web or experimenting with React Router’s new framework capabilities.

If you are migrating an existing project that uses `react-router-dom`, you can continue using it for backward compatibility:

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

However, to take full advantage of the latest features and updates, transitioning to the unified `react-router` package is highly recommended.

## Backward Compatibility and Transition

React Router 7 ensures a seamless upgrade path for projects using React Router 6 (especially versions 6.4 and above). Most existing routes, navigation logic, and core APIs remain compatible. For projects using `react-router-dom`, the functionality remains unchanged, but adopting `react-router` prepares your codebase for future enhancements.

For more details on installation and migration, visit the [**official documentation**](https://reactrouter.com/start/library/installation).

## Key Updates for Library Users

React Router 7 retains the powerful APIs developers know and love while introducing a few key changes to improve functionality and ease of use. If you’re using React Router as a library (not as a framework), these updates are designed to streamline your code without disrupting existing workflows.

How `**defer**` works

## 1\. Simplified Data Handling: `json()` Utility Removal

React Router 6 introduced a `json()` utility function to simplify creating JSON responses in your route loaders. However, in version 7, this function has been removed. Now, you’ll need to construct response objects manually, offering more flexibility while keeping things transparent.

**Example:**

- Before (React Router 6):

```
import { json } from 'react-router-dom';export async function loader() {  return json({ message: 'Welcome to React Router 7!' });}
```

- After (React Router 7):

```
export async function loader() {  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Welcome to React Router 7!' }), {    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },  });}
```

This change ensures developers have a clearer understanding of how responses are structured, making it easier to debug and customize.

## 2\. Streamlined `defer` Functionality

The `defer` function, used to delay data loading while rendering components, has been simplified in React Router 7. The extra wrapper is no longer needed, making it easier to pass promises directly to your loaders.

**Example:**

- Before (React Router 6):

```
import { defer } from 'react-router-dom';export async function loader() {  return defer({    data: fetchData(),  });}
```

- After (React Router 7):

```
export async function loader() {  return {    data: fetchData(),  };}
```

This update reduces boilerplate while maintaining the same powerful functionality, ensuring a smoother developer experience.

## Framework Mode: React Router 7 as a Full-Stack Solution

React Router 7 goes beyond being a simple routing library. It now introduces “framework mode,” empowering developers to build full-stack React applications with advanced features like server-side rendering (SSR), code splitting, and file-based routing. These capabilities streamline development and optimize performance, making it a strong competitor to tools like Next.js and Remix.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*oMuADH2Ocu5OLbs5ybYxbw.png)

## Key Features of Framework Mode

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Pre-renders components on the server to improve SEO and reduce initial load times.
- **Code Splitting:** Dynamically loads only the JavaScript needed for each route, boosting performance.
- **File-Based Routing:** Maps the file system structure to application routes, reducing boilerplate and making route management intuitive.

## How to Set Up Framework Mode

- Install the Core Package Begin by installing the `react-router` package:

```
npm install react-router
```

This package includes all necessary APIs for routing, whether you are building a client-side or full-stack React app.

- Configure Your Project Create a configuration file (e.g., `react-router.config.ts`) in your project root to define project settings:

```
import type { Config } from "react-router";export default {  appDirectory: "src",  ssr: true, } satisfies Config;
```

This setup tells React Router to enable SSR and defines the structure of your application.

- Define Routes Using File-Based Routing Organize your `src` directory to reflect your desired route structure. Each file in the `routes` folder corresponds to a specific route:

**Example File Structure:**

```
src/├── routes/│   ├── index.tsx    // Maps to "/"│   ├── about.tsx    // Maps to "/about"│   └── contact.tsx  // Maps to "/contact"
```

React Router will automatically detect and map these files to their respective routes.

- Enable Server-Side Rendering Use React Router’s SSR tools to pre-render components on the server:

**Example Code:**

```
import { createStaticRouter } from "react-router";import routes from "./routes";const router = createStaticRouter(routes);const html = renderToString(<RouterProvider router={router} />);
```

This configuration allows the server to handle route rendering, improving both performance and SEO.

## Why Framework Mode Matters

Framework mode enables React Router to provide a cohesive full-stack development experience. By integrating routing with SSR, file-based routing, and code splitting, you can manage everything within one tool. This eliminates the need for additional frameworks and allows developers to focus on building great user experiences.

## Upgrading to React Router 7: A Seamless Transition

Transitioning to React Router 7 is designed to be straightforward, especially for applications already utilizing version 6. The React Router team has prioritized backward compatibility, ensuring that existing codebases require minimal adjustments.

***Key Considerations for the Upgrade:***

1. **Unified Package Structure:**

- React Router 7 consolidates previous packages into a single `react-router` package. While `react-router-dom` is still available as a re-export for ease of migration, it's recommended to transition to the unified package.

2\. **Future Flags:**

- To facilitate a smooth upgrade, React Router 6 introduced “future flags” that developers could enable to adopt upcoming changes incrementally. If these flags were activated in your project, the transition to version 7 should be seamless.

3\. **Package Restructuring:**

- The `react-router-dom`, `@remix-run/react`, `@remix-run/server-runtime`, and `@remix-run/router` packages have been merged into the `react-router` package. This consolidation simplifies the dependency tree and streamlines the API surface.

4\. **Removed Adapter Re-exports:**

- In previous versions, Remix re-exported common `@remix-run/server-runtime` APIs through various runtime packages (e.g., node, cloudflare, deno). In version 7, these re-exports have been removed, and developers should import directly from `react-router`.

***Steps to Upgrade:***

1. **Update Dependencies:**

- Modify your project’s dependencies to replace `react-router-dom` with `react-router`. Ensure that all related packages are updated to their latest versions to maintain compatibility.

2\. **Adjust Imports:**

- Update import statements throughout your codebase to reference the new package structure. For example, replace imports from `react-router-dom` with imports from `react-router`.

**3\. Test Thoroughly:**

- After making the necessary changes, conduct comprehensive testing to confirm that all routes and navigation behaviors function as expected.

By following these steps and leveraging the resources provided in the official documentation, developers can confidently upgrade to React Router 7, taking advantage of its enhanced features and unified architecture.

Loader and Action

1. **Unified Package Structure**

In React Router 7, the previously separate packages — `react-router`, `react-router-dom`, and `react-router-native`—have been consolidated into a single `react-router` package. This unification simplifies the installation process and ensures consistency across different platforms.

*Installation:*

```
npm install react-router
```

2\. **Enhanced Data Loading with Loaders and Actions**

Building upon the data loading APIs introduced in version 6.4, React Router 7 offers improved mechanisms for data fetching and mutation through loaders and actions. These functions can now be utilized in both client-side and server-side rendering scenarios, providing flexibility in data management.

*Example Loader Function:*

```
import { json } from "react-router";export async function loader({ params }) {  const data = await fetchData(params.id);  return json(data);}
```

3\. **Improved Nested Routing with Layout Routes**

React Router 7 enhances nested routing by introducing layout routes, which allow developers to define shared layouts for nested routes without redundant code. The `Outlet` component serves as a placeholder for child routes, promoting a clear separation between layout and content.

*Example Layout Route:*

```
import { Outlet } from "react-router";function DashboardLayout() {  return (    <div>      <Sidebar />      <main>        <Outlet />      </main>    </div>  );}<Route path="dashboard" element={<DashboardLayout />}>  <Route path="overview" element={<Overview />} />  <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} /></Route>
```

4\. **Integration with React 18 Features**

With the advent of React 18, React Router 7 fully integrates features like `Suspense` and concurrent rendering. This integration facilitates smoother loading experiences and more responsive user interfaces.

*Example with Suspense:*

```
import { Suspense } from "react";import { Routes, Route } from "react-router";function App() {  return (    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>      <Routes>        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />        <Route path="about" element={<AboutPage />} />      </Routes>    </Suspense>  );}
```

5\. **Type Safety Enhancements**

React Router 7 introduces improved type safety, providing first-class types for route parameters, loader data, actions, and more. This enhancement ensures better developer experience and reduces potential runtime errors.

*Type Inference Example:*

```
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router";type LoaderData = {  user: User;};function UserProfile() {  const data = useLoaderData() as LoaderData;  }
```

These enhancements in React Router 7 collectively contribute to a more robust and developer-friendly routing experience, aligning with modern React features and best practices.

## Code Splitting in React Router 7: Enhancing Performance

In modern web applications, optimizing performance is crucial. One effective strategy is code splitting, which involves loading only the necessary components for each route, reducing the initial load time. React Router 7 simplifies this process, allowing developers to implement code splitting seamlessly.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*vLhl6PSNH5Tq1b-DTvkuwA.png)

## Implementing Code Splitting with React Router 7

React Router 7 leverages React’s `lazy` and `Suspense` features to facilitate code splitting. By dynamically importing components, the application loads only the required code for the current route, enhancing performance.

Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. **Dynamic Component Import:** Utilize React’s `lazy` function to import components dynamically.

```
import { lazy } from 'react';const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./HomePage'));const AboutPage = lazy(() => import('./AboutPage'));
```

2\. **Suspense Boundary:** Wrap the routes with React’s `Suspense` component to handle the loading state while the component is being fetched.

```
import { Suspense } from 'react';import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';function App() {  return (    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>      <Routes>        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />        <Route path="about" element={<AboutPage />} />      </Routes>    </Suspense>  );}export default App;
```

**Benefits of Code Splitting:**

- **Improved Load Times:** By loading only the necessary components, the initial load time decreases, providing a faster user experience.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Resources are loaded on-demand, reducing unnecessary data transfer.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users experience quicker navigation and responsiveness within the application.
