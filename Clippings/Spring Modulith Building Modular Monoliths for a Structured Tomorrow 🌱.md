In the ever-evolving world of software development, the debate between monoliths and microservices has been a long-standing one. While microservices have stolen the spotlight in recent years, there‚Äôs a growing movement in favor of a more balanced approach: **modular monoliths**. And at the heart of this movement is **Spring Modulith** ‚Äì a powerful tool that helps developers design modular monoliths with ease and precision.

> ‚ÄúSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.‚Äù ‚Äì Leonardo da Vinci

Spring Modulith embodies this quote perfectly, offering simplicity in design while maintaining the sophistication necessary for scaling enterprise-level applications. In this article, we‚Äôll dive into what makes **Spring Modulith** a game-changer for software architects, developers, and DevOps teams alike.

## What Is a Modular Monolith? üèóÔ∏è

Before we explore Spring Modulith, let‚Äôs define the term *‚Äúmodular monolith.‚Äù* A **monolith** refers to a large, single application where everything is interconnected. Traditional monoliths often become **difficult to maintain** due to tightly coupled components. Enter the **modular monolith**: a design approach where the application is structured into **modules** ‚Äì distinct, well-organized, and loosely coupled components that can be developed and maintained independently.

By keeping things modular, developers can enjoy the **simplicity of monoliths** while benefiting from the **flexibility of microservices**, without the overhead of managing distributed systems.

## Why Spring Modulith? üí°

Spring Modulith offers a framework for creating modular monoliths while leveraging the strength of **Spring Boot** and the **Spring ecosystem**. Spring Modulith brings discipline to the world of monolithic development by enabling clear **boundaries between modules**, providing support for **event-driven architecture**, and allowing for better **dependency management**.

## Key Features of Spring Modulith:

1\. **Bounded Contexts**: Each module is a self-contained unit that owns its own data and logic, reducing unnecessary coupling.

2\. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Modules can communicate through events, allowing them to remain decoupled while still interacting with each other.

3\. **Strong Testing Support**: Spring Modulith integrates well with Spring Boot‚Äôs testing suite, making it easy to unit test each module in isolation.

Spring Modulith‚Äôs focus on modularity and testing ensures that even when your application encounters setbacks, it can easily rise again, thanks to clear boundaries and strong support for maintainability.

## Benefits of Choosing a Modular Monolith üåü

## 1\. Simplicity and Maintainability üõ†Ô∏è

Modular monoliths provide the simplicity of a single codebase while offering the flexibility to keep code **well-structured** and **modularized**. Spring Modulith takes away the need for complex infrastructure that comes with microservices, making your **DevOps pipeline** much simpler.

## 2\. Separation of Concerns üîç

With modules having distinct responsibilities, you can easily **separate concerns** within your application. This enables your team to work on different parts of the application simultaneously without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes.

## 3\. Performance and Resource Optimization ‚ö°

Microservices often come with the overhead of **network communication**, leading to **latency** and **increased complexity**. With a modular monolith, all communication happens **in-memory**, making it significantly faster.

## 4\. Scalability üìà

Contrary to popular belief, **scalability** is not exclusive to microservices. Modular monoliths can scale both **horizontally** and **vertically**. Additionally, you can break off certain modules into **microservices** if needed, ensuring that your architecture remains flexible for future growth.

## Building a Modular Monolith with Spring Modulith üõ†Ô∏è

Let‚Äôs walk through the process of setting up a simple modular monolith using Spring Modulith. We‚Äôll start by creating two modules: one for managing **users** and another for **orders**. Both modules will be independent but can communicate using **events**.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Start by setting up a basic Spring Boot project. You can either use **Spring Initializr** or create a new project manually. Here‚Äôs the setup for a Maven project:

```
<dependencies>        <dependency>        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>    </dependency>            <dependency>        <groupId>org.springframework.modulith</groupId>        <artifactId>spring-modulith-starter-core</artifactId>    </dependency>            <dependency>        <groupId>org.springframework.modulith</groupId>        <artifactId>spring-modulith-starter-jpa</artifactId>    </dependency></dependencies>
```

## Step 2: Defining Modules

In Spring Modulith, modules are defined using **@Module** annotations. Let‚Äôs define two modules: UserModule and OrderModule.

```
@Modulepublic class UserModule {    }@Modulepublic class OrderModule {    private final ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;    public OrderModule(ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher) {        this.eventPublisher = eventPublisher;    }    public void createOrder(Order order) {                eventPublisher.publishEvent(new OrderCreatedEvent(order.getId()));    }}
```

Each module contains its own logic, and you can organize them as separate **packages** or even **maven submodules**. This creates a clear **separation of concerns**.

## Step 3: Using ApplicationModuleListener for Event Handling

Now, let‚Äôs connect the modules. The UserModule will respond to an event published by the OrderModule when a new order is created. We‚Äôll use **ApplicationModuleListener** to handle this interaction.

First, define an event class that will be triggered when an order is created:

```
public class OrderCreatedEvent {    private final Long orderId;    public OrderCreatedEvent(Long orderId) {        this.orderId = orderId;    }    public Long getOrderId() {        return orderId;    }}
```

Next, in the UserModule, we use the ApplicationModuleListener to listen for the OrderCreatedEvent:

```
@Componentpublic class UserEventListener {    @ApplicationModuleListener    public void onOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) {        System.out.println("UserModule received OrderCreatedEvent for order ID: " + event.getOrderId());            }}
```

## Step 4: Persisting Data with JPA

Since we‚Äôve included **spring-modulith-starter-jpa**, we can persist our Order entities with ease.

```
@Entitypublic class Order {    @Id    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)    private Long id;    private String orderName;    }
```

To persist an order when it‚Äôs created in OrderModule, we simply use a JpaRepository:

```
@Repositorypublic interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {}@Servicepublic class OrderService {    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;    public OrderService(OrderRepository orderRepository) {        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;    }    public Order createOrder(Order order) {        return orderRepository.save(order);    }}
```

## Managing Dependencies with Spring Modulith üîó

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*AeX4y0z8V8sCWTb_OQop2A@2x.jpeg)

One of the key principles in a **modular monolith** is managing **dependencies**. Spring Modulith provides tools to enforce module boundaries and ensure that modules don‚Äôt depend on each other **inappropriately**.

For example, you can use the **@Dependency** annotation to specify which modules can interact with each other.

```
@Dependency(UserModule.class)public class OrderModule {    }
```

This ensures that your modules remain **loosely coupled**, and any accidental **tight coupling** is caught early.

## Testing and Validation üß™

With modules having clear boundaries, testing becomes much easier. You can test each module in **isolation**, ensuring that changes in one module don‚Äôt affect the others. Spring Modulith integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot‚Äôs testing framework, making it simple to write **unit** and **integration** tests.

Here‚Äôs an example of a unit test for the **OrderModule**:

```
@SpringBootTestpublic class OrderModuleTests {    @Autowired    private OrderService orderService;    @Test    public void testCreateOrder() {        Order order = new Order(1L, "Sample Order");        orderService.createOrder(order);            }}
```

By testing each module independently, you can ensure that your code remains **robust** and **maintainable**.

## Real-World Use Case: How Spring Modulith Powers Large-Scale Systems üåê

Spring Modulith has been adopted by many large-scale organizations to manage complex systems while keeping things simple. One such example is a **financial services** company that needed to scale its existing monolithic system without the overhead of microservices. By adopting Spring Modulith, they were able to **modularize** their application, improve **team productivity**, and **reduce downtime** during deployments.

Their system now handles millions of transactions daily, with each module managing a different aspect of the business ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs user authentication, transaction processing, or fraud detection. Thanks to Spring Modulith‚Äôs **event-driven architecture**, the modules communicate efficiently, while the system remains easy to scale and maintain.
