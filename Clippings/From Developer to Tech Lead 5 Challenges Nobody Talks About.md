## Tech leadership

“The duality of technical leadership: maintaining your edge while creating a nurturing environment for your team to grow.” \[Image: AI Generated\]

My first experience as a Tech Lead was a *disaster*. When I was asked to lead a React Native project for a prestigious Chilean hospital, I thought it would be my chance to shine. Instead, it became a *crucible of stress and burnout that made me swear off leadership for the next two years*. I retreated back to the comfort of being “just a developer,” nursing my wounded confidence and questioning if I was cut out for leadership at all.

Then came an opportunity that would change everything: “We want you to lead the frontend architecture team for Autodesk.” My immediate impulse was to decline. The memories of 5 AM coding sessions and family dinners interrupted by emergency calls were still fresh. But something was different this time — *I was different*. Those two years of reflection had taught me that *my first failure wasn’t about my technical abilities*; it was about my approach to leadership itself.

I decided to take the role, but with a radical new perspective: *what if leadership wasn’t about being a superhero developer who could do it all?* What if, instead, it was simply ==**another skill set to learn**== — like picking up a new programming language or framework?

That mindset shift changed everything. During my three years leading teams for Autodesk, my growth as a technical leader was recognized by Globant, being named as one of their *top 10 leaders managing US-based enterprise teams (2022)*. More importantly, I evolved to mentor and *lead other Tech Leads*, multiplying the impact of these lessons across multiple teams and Fortune 500 clients.

Today, I want to share *the five most surprising challenges* of this transition, and more importantly, how to overcome them. These aren’t just lessons from my successes — they’re hard-won *insights from my failures that transformed leadership from a source of dread into one of the most rewarding aspects of my career.*

## 1\. The Superman Syndrome: You Can’t (and Shouldn’t) Do It All

I remember those 21-hour days: meetings from 8 AM, coding until dawn, learning five different disciplines simultaneously. *I thought being a great Tech Lead meant being the best at everything. I was wrong*.

**The Real Challenge:** Understanding that *your role isn’t to be a superhero*, but to build and empower a ***team of heroes***.

**How to Navigate It:**

- ==Accept that delegation isn’t failure —== ==*it’s*== ==***multiplication***== ==*of impact*==
- *Create opportunities for team members* to become experts in different areas
- Focus on building systems and processes *that don’t depend on you*
- ==Remember:== ==*A burned-out Tech Lead helps*== ==***no one***==

## 2\. The Transformation from Player to Coach

The hardest part wasn’t learning new technologies — it was *learning to stop being the one who implements everything*. Every time I wrote code at 3 AM, I was *robbing someone on my team of a growth opportunity*.

**The Real Challenge:** Shifting your mindset from being the *star player* to being the *coach who builds star players*.

**How to Navigate It:**

- *Create learning opportunities* through thoughtful ticket assignment
- *Trust your team to explore* and sometimes **fail**
- Focus on *teaching* and *mentoring* rather than doing
- Celebrate when *your* *team solves problems without you*

## 3\. The Trust Tightrope

A senior developer on my team had a different approach to architecture than what I envisioned. *My instinct was to enforce my way*. This led to tension until I realized that leadership is about fostering trust and enabling ***diverse perspectives***.

**The Real Challenge:** Finding the sweet spot between providing technical direction and *trusting your team’s judgment*.

**How to Navigate It:**

- Establish *clear architectural principles* rather than strict rules
- Create spaces for *technical discussions* where ***everyone*** *can contribute*
- Learn to *influence through questions* rather than directives
- Build trust by acknowledging and *implementing team members’ ideas*

## 4\. The Productivity Paradox

Early in my Tech Lead journey, I thought productivity meant filling every hour with work. I’d schedule back-to-back meetings, code during lunch, and push through exhaustion. Then I learned the hard way: ***leadership isn’t about working more hours — it’s about making the hours you work count.***

**The Real Challenge:** Understanding that sustainable leadership requires *managing your* ***energy****, not just your time*.

**How to Navigate It:**

- Identify your *peak productivity hours* and protect them fiercely
- Schedule deliberate downtime during your workday — *it’s not a luxury, it’s a necessity*
- Learn to recognize your *personal warning signs of burnout*
- Block *“recovery time”* between high-intensity activities
- Create boundaries that *protect your energy* (like no-meeting blocks)

**What worked for me:**

- I discovered my best architectural decisions came after a morning walk, *not after a 3-hour meeting marathon*
- Started *scheduling “thinking time” in my calendar* — treated it as importantly as client meetings
- Learned to say *“let me think about that and get back to you”* instead of making decisions when drained
- Found that a *30-minute break often solved problems that 2 hours of forced focus couldn’t*

Remember: Your team needs a *clear-headed leader more than they need a burned-out hero*. When you *take care of yourself, you’re actually taking care of your team.*

## 5\. The Leadership Learning Curve

Just when I mastered my technical stack, I had to learn an entirely new one: people skills, project management, business communication, and team dynamics. What I discovered was liberating: ==***leadership is a skill set like any other — it can be learned, practiced, and improved***==***.***

**The Real Challenge:** Accepting that *you’re a beginner again* in many ways.

**How to Navigate It:**

- Approach leadership skills with *the same learning mindset* you use for technical skills
- Find ***mentors*** who’ve made this transition successfully
- Read, practice, and iterate on *your leadership style*
- *Be patient with yourself* as you develop these new capabilities

## The Path Forward

Looking back, *the transformation from hands-on developer to Tech Lead wasn’t about becoming a different person* — it was about ***expanding my toolkit***. That journey took me from *burning out* in my first leadership role to being *recognized by Globant as one of their top 10 leaders managing US-based enterprise teams*. Each step was a lesson in applying *the same growth mindset we use for technical skills to leadership itself.*

The key is understanding that leadership, like programming, is *a skill that can be systematically improved*. You wouldn’t expect to become a senior developer overnight, so why expect to master leadership immediately? *Give yourself permission to learn, fail, and grow in this new domain.*

Remember: Your success as a Tech Lead *isn’t measured by your technical contributions anymore*, but by *your team’s growth and impact*. Embrace this journey of skill acquisition, and you’ll find that *leading a team can be as rewarding as solving the most complex technical challenge.*
